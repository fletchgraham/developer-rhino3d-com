          <h2 id="61-tuples">6.1 Tuples</h2>

<p>We’ve already been using tuples and lists in examples and I’ve always told you not to worry about it. Those days are officially over. Now is the time to panic. Perhaps it’s best if we just get the obvious stuff out of the way first:</p>

<p><strong>Tuples, Lists and Dictionaries are just a collection of things!</strong></p>

<p>That’s really all there is to it. Sometimes -in fact quite often- you want to store a large or unknown amount of things. You could of course declare 15,000 different variables by hand but that is generally considered to be bad practice. Remember, Tuples, Lists and Dictionaries always start counting at zero, while us humans are normally used to start counting at one. Try it by counting the number of fingers on your right hand. Chances are you are someone who has just counted to five. Code would disagree with you, it would only have counted to four:</p>

<p><img src="/images/primer-arraycountingfingers.png" class="img-center" width="25%" /></p>

<p>It helps to refer to numbers as ‘indices’ when you use the zero-based counting system just to avoid confusion. So when we talk about the ‘first element’ of a tuple we actually mean ‘the element with index 0’. I know this all sounds strange, but zero-based counting systems habitually confuse even the most die-hard programmer.</p>

<p>A tuple consists of a number of values separated by commas, for instance:</p>

<pre><code class="language-python">t = 12345, 5421, 'hello!' # Creating a Tuple with a variable name t
print(t[0]) # print the first value of the Tuple t
# This returns 12345 - the first value inside the Tuple
print(t)
# This returns (12345, 54321, 'hello!') - all of the values within the Tuple
</code></pre>

<p>Tuples can be used for coordinates (x,y) or any other time you need to store various elements.  Tuples may contain multiple variables, nested Tuples, Lists or other objects. If you remember from section 4.5, Tuples are immutable, meaning that they cannot be changed! (Refer to section 4.5 on Mutability) That means that we cannot create a Tuple then remove an element, instead we need to create an entirely new Tuple that contains the desired change.  A number of RhinoscriptSyntax methods return tuples rather than lists for their simplicity.  When utilizing the RhinoscriptSyntax methods make sure to be particularly careful with the input and return types (numbers, strings, tuples, lists etc) and understand how to pass or use each of them. This is a common source of errors in people’s code, so pay special attention to read the methods found in the RhinoscriptSyntax help file!</p>

<h2 id="62-lists">6.2 Lists</h2>

<p>Lists are just like Tuples, however they can be changed (mutable), they use brackets rather than parenthesis and  have far more powerful built-in functionality!  Lists can be added to, items can be removed, they can be sorted, sliced apart, nested with multiple levels of inner lists and packed with other objects.  Lists are very powerful!</p>

<pre><code class="language-python">myList = [] #This creates an empty list with the variable name myList
myList.append(5)
myList.append(6)
print myList[0]
# This returns 5 - the first element (0th item) in the list
print(myList)
# This returns [5,6] - the entire contents of the list myList
</code></pre>

<p>Lists also can be sliced by using the following syntax:</p>

<pre><code class="language-python">myList = [1,2,3,4] #This creates a list with elements 1,2,3,4
print (myList[1:3])
#This returns [2,3] - the 1st and 2nd elements of the list
</code></pre>

<p>Similar to the range() function, the syntax for slicing list[start:end] - begins with the index of “start” (from the 0th element) and finishes at 1 less than the index “end.” To create a copy of a list we can also use a similar syntax:</p>

<pre><code class="language-python">myList = [1,2,3,4] #This creates a list with elements 1,2,3,4
dupList = myList[:]
</code></pre>
<p>Some useful methods for lists:</p>

<h3 id="621-list-comprehension">6.2.1 List Comprehension</h3>

<p>List comprehensions are a way of utilizing the functionality of Lists and For…Loops with very concise syntax. The list comprehension begins with an expression then has a For…Loop - effectively executing the expression for the number of times specified in the For…Loop. This will create a List with the resultant values from the expression. For example:</p>

<pre><code class="language-python">myList = [2,4,6] #This creates a list with elements 2,4,6
print ([3*x for x in myList]
# This returns [6,12,18] as the resultant calculation from the List Comprehension
</code></pre>

<p>List comprehensions can become far more complex and include more complicated expressions, loops and conditional statements.  One last example:</p>

<pre><code class="language-python">myList = [2,4,6] #This creates a list with elements 2,4,6
print ([3*x for x in myList if x&gt;3]
# This returns [12,18] as the resultant calculation from the expression, loop and conditional
</code></pre>

<p>The following example should teach you almost all there is to know about lists, except nesting:</p>

<pre class="line-numbers"><code class="language-python">import rhinoscriptsyntax as rs

def myfavoritethings():
    things = []

    while True:
        count = len(things)
        prompt = "What is your {0}th most favorite thing?".format(count+1)
        if len(things)==0:
            prompt = "What is your most favorite thing?"
        elif count==1:
            prompt = "What is your second most favorite thing?"
        elif count==2:
            prompt = "What is your third most favourite thing?"

        answer = rs.GetString(prompt)
        if answer is None: break
        things.append(answer)
    if len(things)==0: return

    print "Your", len(things)+1, "favorite things are:"
    for i,thing in enumerate(things): print i+1, ".", thing
</code></pre>

<table class="multiline">
<tr>
<th>Line</th>
<th>Description</th>
</tr>
<tr>

<td>We do not know how many favourite things the user has, so there's no way we can set the list to a certain size in advance. Luckily, we do not have to. Items can be appended to a list on an as needed basis!</td>

We then print the index of the user's nth favority thing, and the favorite thing.</td>

<h2 id="63-dictionaries">6.3 Dictionaries</h2>

<p>Dictionaries go one step further than lists because they store a “key” and an associated value.  Every dictionary contains a series of key : value associations.  This is very similar to actual word-based dictionaries that contain words and their associated definition.  Python Dictionaries can use any immutable type for the “key”, such as; strings, numbers, Tuples (they can only contain strings, numbers or tuples and NOT lists). The value can be any mutable or immutable item that will become associated to the key (this includes, lists or other dictionaries). Lets see an example:</p>

<pre><code class="language-python">emptyDict = {} #This creates an empty Dictionary
myDict = {'a':1,'b':2,'c':3} #This creates a Dictionary with its associated Key:Value pairs
myDict['d'] = 4 #This Adds a key:value to the Dictionary
myDict['a'] = 2 #This Changes the key "a"'s value to 2 rather than 1
print (myDict['a'])
#This returns 2 - the associated value to the key "a"
print (myDict)
#This returns {'a': 2, 'c': 3, 'b': 2, 'd': 4} - the entire Dictionary
print (myDict.keys())
#This returns ['a', 'c', 'b', 'd'] - a list containing all of the Keys
del myDict['b'] # This deletes the Key "b" and its associated value of 2
</code></pre>

<p>Because of the associated Key:Value relationship, Dictionaries are great for representing points and giving them an associated name based on the points relationship to their neighbors.  Let’s say we have a surface and we want to extract points across the surface with rows and columns.  Each point has a 3D point coordinate [x,y,z] which is represented as a list who’s first element 0 corresponds to x, element 1 corresponds to y and element 2 corresponds to z. If we wanted to store these points we have 2 options. We could create a list with internal lists that contain the point coordinates (one long linear organization of points) or we could use a Dictionary to add point coordinates as values and have a Key that is a name in relation to its Row/Column position.  The second option then allows us to take any point on the surface and know its 4, 8 or however many neighbors because they are named accordingly.  The first option would only allow us to know the neighbor direction in front or behind it in line.  We will get into this more later, but this should wet your appetite for the exciting potential of lists and dictionaries for geometric information!</p>

<h2 id="64-points-and-vectors">6.4 Points and Vectors</h2>

<p>As was just explained, points are represented by lists containing three values - [x,y,z]. This notation is used for both points and vectors. First, a point example:</p>

<pre class="line-numbers"><code class="language-python">import rhinoscriptsyntax as rs
import math

#Call rs.EnableRedraw(False)
for t in rs.frange(-50,50,1.25):
    arrPoint = [t * math.sin(5*t), t * math.cos(5*t),t]

   print(arrPoint)
   rs.AddPoint(arrPoint)
#Call rs.EnableRedraw(True)
</code></pre>

<p><img src="/images/primer-pointspiral.svg" alt="/images/primer-pointspiral.svg" class="float-img-right" width="375" /></p>

<p>The variable arrPoint is declared as an empty list, the elements are assigned different values on lines 7 to 9 inside the body of the loop. On line 10 the list is printed and on line 11 it is used as the point coordinates to create a 3D point in space.</p>

<p>Vectors are a slightly new concept. Those of you who are familiar with the essentials of geometrical mathematics will have no problems with this concept… in fact you probably all are familiar with the essentials of geometrical mathematics or you wouldn’t be learning how to program a 3D CAD platform.</p>

<p>Vectors are indistinguishable from points. That is, they are both lists of three numbers so there’s absolutely no way of telling whether a certain list represents a point or a vector. There is a practical difference though; points are absolute, vectors are relative. When we treat a list of three doubles as a point it represents a certain coordinate in space, when we treat it as a vector it represents a certain direction. You see, a vector is an arrow in space which always starts at the world origin (0.0, 0.0, 0.0) and ends at the specified coordinate.</p>

<p><img src="/images/primer-vectordefinition.svg" alt="/images/primer-vectordefinition.svg" class="float-img-right" width="375" /></p>

<p>The picture on the right shows two vector definitions; a purple and a blue one. The blue one happens to have all positive components while the purple one has only negative components. Both vectors have a different direction and a different length. When I say vectors are relative, I mean that they only indicate the difference between the start and end points of the arrow, i.e. vectors are not actual geometrical entities, they are only information! The blue vector could represent the tangent direction of the black curve at parameter {t}. If we also know the point value of the curve at parameter {t}, we know what the tangent of the curve looks like; we know where in space the tangent belongs. The vector itself does not contain this information; the orange and the blue vector are identical in every respect.</p>

<p>The addition of vector definitions in IronPython is accompanied by a whole group of point/vector related methods which perform the basic operations of ‘vector mathematics’. Addition, subtraction, multiplication, dot and cross products, so on and so forth. The table on the following page is meant as a reference table, do not waste your time memorizing it.</p>

<p>I will be using standard mathematical notation:</p>

<ul>
  <li>A lowercase letter represents a number</li>
  <li>A lowercase letter with a dot above it represents a point</li>
  <li>A lowercase letter with an arrow above it represents a vector</li>
  <li>Vertical bars are used to denote vector length</li>
</ul>

I shall define a function here called <em>AddVector()</em> which we will use in examples to come. The function must be able to take two arguments; one vector definition and a point definition. If the point array is not defined the vector will be drawn starting at the world origin.</p>

<p>There’s nothing to it. A list (or tuple or dictionary for that matter) becomes nested when it is stored inside another list The VectorField example on the previous page deals with a list of points (a list of lists, each with three doubles). The image on the right is a visualization of such a structure. The left most column represents the base list, the one containing all coordinates. It can be any size you like, there’s no limit to the amount of points you can store in a single list. Every element of this base list is a standard Rhino point. In the case of point-lists all the nested lists are three elements long, but this is not a requisite, you can store anything you want in a list.</p>

<p>Nesting can be done with tuples, lists or dictionaries. It simply means that you can put lists in lists, or tuples in tuples, dictionaries in dictionaries or even lists inside of dictionaries and so on.  Nesting can be done infinitely, you can have a list that contains a list with a list inside of it, another list inside of that list and so on. Nesting can easily be done by utilizing a Loop that allows you to iterate and either extract or place other items inside of the lists.</p>

<p>Accessing nested lists follows the same rules as accessing regular lists. Using the VectorField example:</p>

<pre><code class="language-python">    arrSeventhPoint = arrPoints[6] #arrSeventhPoint now equals the 7th (starting from 0th) element
    arrLastPoint = arrPoints[len(arrPoints)] #arrLastPoint now equals the last point in the list
</code></pre>

<p>Len() can be used to get the length of a list. In this case we are saying that arrLastPoint equals the last element in the list called arrPoints because we have given it the numeric value that is the length of the list. This shows how to extract entire nested lists. Assuming the illustration on this page represents <i>arrPoints</i>, <i>arrSeventhPoint</i> will be identical to <i>[0.3, -1.5, 4.9]</i>. If we want to access individual coordinates directly we can use another bracket to explode out the z value:</p>

<pre><code class="language-pyton">dblSeventhPointHeight = arrPoints[6][2]
#2 corresponds to the 3rd element (the Z coordinate) within that nested list.
</code></pre>

<p>The above code will store the third element of the nested list stored in the seventh element of the base list in <em>dblSeventhPointHeight</em>. This corresponds with the orange block.</p>

<p>Nested lists can be parsed using nested loops like so:</p>

<pre><code class="language-python">for i in range(0,len(arrPoints)):
    for j in range(0,2):
        print("Coordinate(" + i + ", " + j + ") = " + arrPoints[i][j])
</code></pre>

<p><img src="/images/primer-nestedarrayparsehistory.png" class="img-center" width="45%" /></p>

<p>Remember the scaling script from before? We’re now going to take curve-length adjustment to the next level
using nested lists. The logic of this script will be the same, but the algorithm for shortening a curve will be replaced with the following one (the illustration shows the first eight iterations of the algorithm):</p>

<p><img src="/images/primer-curvesmoothing.svg" class="img-center" width="100%" /></p>

<p>Every control-point or ‘vertex’ of the original curve (except the ones at the end) will be averaged with its neighbors in order to smooth the curve. With every iteration the curve will become shorter and we will abort as soon a certain threshold length has been reached. The curve can never become shorter than the distance between the first and last control-point, so we need to make sure our goals are actually feasible before we start a potentially endless loop. Note that the algorithm is approximating, it may not be endless but it could still take a long time to complete. We will not support closed or periodic curves.</p>

<p>We’re going to put the vector math bit in a separate function. This function will compute the {vM} vector given the control points {pN-1; p; pN+1} and a smoothing factor {s}. Since this function is not designed to fail, we will not be adding any error checking, if the thing crashes we’ll have to fix the bug. Instead of using variable naming conventions, I’ll use the same codes as in the diagram:</p>

<pre class="line-numbers"><code class="language-python">def smoothingvector(point, prev_point, next_point, s):
    pm = (prev_point+next_point)/2.0
    va = rs.VectorCreate(pm, point)
    vm = rs.VectorScale(va, s)
    return vm
</code></pre>

<table class="multiline">
<tr>
<th>Line</th>
<th>Description</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>2</td>
<td>The smoothingvector function definition takes input of Rhino.Point3d. This object type allows for explicit point addition. The act of adding two Point3d objects together results in vector addition of the two points. The act of dividing the resulting point by 2.0 simply divides the three components (x,y and z) by 2.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>3</td>
<td>The VectorCreate() function is called in order to obtain a Rhino.Vector3d with information about the directional components of a vector between points Pm, and point, P  being the origin. The math is effectively the same as Pm - Point = Va, but this operation would not have yielded a Rhion.Vector3d object. The VectorCreate() function creates this object efficiently.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>4</td>
<td>Finally, we call the <i>Rhino.VectorScale()</i> function, which takes a Rhino.Vector3d object, and scales it according to a predetermined scaling factor 's'.
When we use this algorithm, we must make sure to set 's' to be something sensible, or the loop might become endless: 0.0 1 {s} # 1.0</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>5</td>
<td>We return the vector vm.</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>We’ll also put the entire curve-smoothing algorithm in a separate function. Since it’s fairly hard to adjust existing objects in Rhino, we’ll be adding a new curve and deleting the existing one:</p>

<pre class="line-numbers"><code class="language-python">def smoothcurve(curve_id, s):
    curve_points = rs.CurvePoints(curve_id)
    new_curve_points = []

    for i in range(1, len(curve_points)-1):
        vm = smoothingvector(curve_points[i], curve_points[i-1], curve_points[i+1], s)
        new_curve_points.append( rs.PointAdd(curve_points[i], vm) )

    knots = rs.CurveKnots(curve_id)
    degree = rs.CurveDegree(curve_id)
    weights = rs.CurveWeights(curve_id,0)
    newcurve_id = rs.AddNurbsCurve(new_curve_points, knots, degree, weights)
    if newcurve_id: rs.DeleteObject(curve_id)
    return newcurve_id
</code></pre>

<table class="multiline">
<tr>
<th>Line</th>
<th>Description</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>2</td>
<td>Retrieve the nested list of curve control points, and store it in curve_points.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>3</td>
<td>We need a second list to contain the new points, while leaving the initial curve_points list intact.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>5</td>
<td>This loop will start at one and stop one short of the length of the curve_points list. In other words, we're skipping the first and last items in the array.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>6</td>
<td>Compute the smoothing vector using the current control point, the previous one (<i>i-1</i>) and the next one (<i>i+1</i>). Since we're omitting the first and last point in the array, every point we're dealing with has two neighbors.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>7</td>
<td>Set the new control point position. The new coordinate equals the old coordinate plus the smoothing vector.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>9...11</td>
<td>We'll be adding a new curve to the document which is identical to the existing one, but with different control point positions. A nurbs curve is defined by four different blocks of data: control points, knots, weights and degree (see paragraph 7.7 Nurbs Curves). We just need to copy the other bits from the old curve.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>12</td>
<td>Create a new nurbs curve and store the object ID in the variable newcurve_id.</td>
</tr>
<tr>

</table>

<p>The top-level subroutine doesn’t contain anything you’re not already familiar with:</p>

<pre><code class="language-python">def iterativeshortencurve():
    curve_id = rs.GetObject("Open curve to smooth", 4, True)
    if curve_id is None or rs.IsCurveClosed(curve_id): return

    min = rs.Distance(rs.CurveStartPoint(curve_id), rs.CurveEndPoint(curve_id))
    max = rs.CurveLength(curve_id)
    goal = rs.GetReal("Goal length", 0.5*(min+max) , min, max)
    if goal is None: return

    while rs.CurveLength(curve_id)&gt;goal:
        rs.EnableRedraw(False)
        curve_id = smoothcurve(curve_id, 0.1)
        rs.EnableRedraw(True)
        if curve_id is None: break
