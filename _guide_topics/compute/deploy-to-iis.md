## Overview

This guide will walk you through how to setup an instance of rhino.compute on a virtual machine running Internet Information Services (IIS). [IIS](https://www.iis.net/), is a flexible, general-purpose web server developed by Microsoft which can be configured to serve requested HTML pages or files. We can setup IIS to process incoming requests (either from Hops or some other client) and forward that request to the rhino.compute instance. 

You may be asking yourself, "Why do I need IIS at all? Why can't I simply launch the rhino.compute server and send API requests directly to that instance?". Technically speaking, you don't need IIS. However, you would need to figure out how to relaunch the compute server should it crash or malfunction. You would also need to configure rhino.compute to launch whenever the virtual machine is launched. 

One of the main benefits of using IIS as a middleware is that it can automatically spin up an instance of the rhino.compute server whenever a request is recieved. With this configuration, you do not have to have compute running continuously. Instead, IIS can launch an instance of compute when it is needed which in turn will launch one or more child processes. These child processes are what perform the actual computation and also what require your license authorization. 

When rhino.compute.exe does not receive requests to solve over a period of seconds (this is called idlespans and the default is set to 1 hour), child compute.geometry.exe processes will shut down and stop incurring core hour billing. At some date in the future when a new request is received, IIS will make sure that rhino.compute.exe is running which will then relaunch the child processes. Note, there may be some small delay in the response while the child processes are launching.

## Prerequisites

Before running the bootstrap script on your server or virtual machine, you will need the following pieces of information.

* **`EmailAddress`** - The script will use this email to download a copy of Rhino to install. This is similar to the Rhino download page behavior.
* **`ApiKey`** - The API key is a string of text that is secret to your compute server and your applications that are using the compute API e.g. `b8f91f04-3782-4f1c-87ac-8682f865bf1b`. It is basically how the compute server ensures that the API calls are coming from your apps only. You can enter any string that is unique and secret to you and your compute apps. Make sure to keep this in a safe place.
* **`RhinoToken`** â€“ This is a long token that identifies your instance of Rhino Compute to the core-hour billing system. Go to the [Licenses Portal](https://www.rhino3d.com/licenses?_forceEmpty=true) to generate this unique id based on your license. See ["Using Core-Hour Billing" guide](../core-hour-billing/#using-core-hour-billing) for more information.

<div class="alert alert-info" role="alert">
Running rhino compute locally uses your existing Rhino license and does not cost any additional money (other than your initial rhino license investment). Running compute locally is the best option for development and testing and to find out more, read <a href="../development"><u>Running and Debugging Compute Locally</u></a>.<br><br>

However, when setting up a production environment you will need a server or virtual machine pre-installed with Windows Server 2019 or higher. Licensing works differently when running Rhino (ie. via Compute) in a production environment (ie. server-setting) and you will be charged at a rate of <strong>$0.10 per core per hour</strong>. <br><br>

Follow the <a href="../core-hour-billing"><u>"Core-Hour Billing" guide</u></a> to get set up. <b>This is important so do not skip.</b>

## Create the VM

The first step in the process of deploying **rhino.compute** for production is to either setup a physical machine to act as a server or create a virtual machine (VM). For this guide, we will be using a virtual machine. There are several popular services which can be configured to setup a wide array of virtual machines depending on your resource needs. Two of the most prominent providers include [Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/free/virtual-machines/) and [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/).  

Depending on your preferences, we recommend starting with an Azure or AWS VM. Use the following guides to walkthrough that process.

* [Create a Virtual Machine on Azure](../creating-an-Azure-VM).

* [Create a Virtual Machine on AWS](../creating-an-aws-vm).

### Connect via RDP

Now that we've configured the virtual machine, we need to be able to log onto it so that we can setup IIS and the rhino.compute instance. We'll do this by using a remote desktop protocol (RDP) which connects two computers over a network.

To start, let's download the RDP file. We'll use the Azure VM Portal but a similar process is used for AWS.

1. First, make sure the virtual machine is running. Click on the **Overview** tab in the left-hand menu. If the *Status* says *Stopped (Deallocated)*, click on the **Start** button at the top to start the remote machine. After a few seconds, the status should say *Running*.

1. Click on the **Connect** menu item in the left-hand menu to pull out the connection settings blade.

1. Click on the **Download RDP File** button and save the file somewhere on your computer.
<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/Azure_VM_Connect1.png">{: .img-center  width="100%"}

1. Click on the Windows **Start** menu and start typing *remote desktop connection* in the search bar. Click on the link to launch app.

1. Click on the button at the bottom of the app to **Show Options**

1. Under the *Connection Settings* area, select **Open** and navigate to the directory where you saved your RDP file. Choose that file and hit Open.

1. Select the checkbox to **Allow me to save credentials**

1. Click **Connect**.
<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/Azure_VM_Connect2.png">{: .img-center  width="60%"}

1. A security pop-up will be opened. Click the checkbox for **Don't ask me again for connections to this computer** and then click **Connect**.

1. Enter the administrator credentials that you entered in step 7 of [Creating a Virtual Machine](../deploy-to-iis/#setting-up-a-virtual-machine).

1. You may see another security pop-up. Again, select **Don't ask me again for connections to this computer** and click **Yes**.

Congratulations. You should now have access to the desktop of the remote machine running Windows Server 2019 or higher.

## Running the Bootstrap script
Assuming that you are now logged into the virtual machine (using RDP), follow the following steps to install rhino compute behind IIS.

1. Click on the Windows Start menu and type in "Powershell". In the menu that appears, right-click on the **Windows Powershell app** and choose **Run As Administrator**.
<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/powershell_1.png">{: .img-center  width="50%"}

1. **Copy and paste** the command below and hit **Enter**. This command will download the latest bootstrap script and install rhino compute on this machine. Note: you will be prompted to enter your **Email**, **API Key**, and **Rhino Token**, so please have that information handy.

   ```powershell
   $F="/bootstrap.zip";$T="$($Env:temp)\tmp$([convert]::tostring((get-random 65535),16).padleft(4,'0')).tmp"; New-Item -ItemType Directory -Path $T; iwr -useb https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mcneel/compute.rhino3d/master/script/production/bootstrap.zip -outfile $T$F; Expand-Archive $T$F -DestinationPath $T; Remove-Item $T$F;& "$T\boostrap_server.ps1" 
   ```
1. At the end of the installation process, you should see the following message in the powershell window, *"Congratulations! All components have now been installed."*

## Testing the app

At this point, IIS should be configured to launch the rhino.compute instance when an API request is made. You can test this by opening a web browser on your local machine (not the VM) and typing in "http://" followed by the IP address of the virtual machine followed by a `:` and the port number (80) followed by "/activechildren". So, the full address would look something like this:
            
    http://52.168.38.105:80/activechildren

The `/activechildren` endpoint will return an integer value for the number of child processes that were started by rhino.compute (the default is 4). 

If you've succeeded in returning a numeric value larger than zero, then at least one child process has been started. Next, let's try getting Hops to send a definition to that URL.

1. Launch **Rhino** on your local machine.

1. If you have not already installed hops on this machine, please do so by searching for it in the Rhino **Package Manager**.

1. Start **Grasshopper** by typing the word *Grasshopper* into the command prompt and hitting enter.

1. Go to **File** and then **Preferences** to open the preferences dialog. 

1. Click on the **Solver** tab in the left-hand menu. 

1. In the **Hops - Compute server URLs** section, type in the web address from above (do not include the `/activechildren` endpoint). Your URL should look something like this.

1. In the **API Key** section, enter the API Key that you saved in the [Prerequisites](../deploy-to-iis/#prerequisites) section.
<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/Hops_To_IIS_4.png">{: .img-center  width="80%"}

1. Add a **Hops** component to the **Grasshopper canvas** (Params/Util)

1. Right-click on the **Hops** component and set the **Path** to a valid Hops/Grasshopper definition. To learn more about setting up a Grasshopper definition that will work properly with Hops, [follow this guide](../hops-component/).
<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/Hops_To_IIS_2.png">{: .img-center  width="50%"}

Once the path is set, the Hops component will create the appropriate API request and sends it to the URL that we specified in step 6 (the rhino.compute server running on IIS). The compute server processes the request and sends a response back to Hops, which returns the result.

Congratulations! You have successfully setup an instance of rhino.compute running behind IIS on a virtual machine.
